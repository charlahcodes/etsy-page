Here are several questions we get quite often that might help to understand what we offer:\r\n\r\n+ FAQ +\r\n\r\nQ: Do you offer custom or personalised prints? How much does this cost?\r\nA: A resounding yes! We cherish doing custom or personalised work. We don&#39;t charge you any additional fee for doing it either! All we ask is that you purchase the custom listing we&#39;ll set up for you first before we begin any work. Once you&#39;ve done that, we&#39;ll work directly with you by sending you proofs and revisions until we reach a final approved design.\r\n\r\nQ: Do your photos come framed? How much does it cost to add a frame?\r\nA: Unfortunately, no. All of the frames pictured in our listing photos are simply mockups and were created to demonstrate how your print will appear once framed. We can however make recommendations of affordable framers in your area as well as being able to recommend what you need to ask a framer to get your order to look like ours.\r\n\r\nQ: How long does it take for you to ship my print?\r\nA: We process all orders the day that they are placed and get them printed and shipped out anywhere between 3-5 days for standard orders! Prints that are oversized  may take 7-14 days before shipment.\r\n\r\nQ: But my order is time sensitive! Do you offer rush shipping?\r\nA: Yes! We offer shipping upgrades to ensure a speedier delivery. If you need it really quick, please contact us and we&#39;ll see what else we can do. A lot of times with rush order we can have your order in your possession in 48-72 hours (in the USA). International orders can be rushed, but a 48 hour turnaround can be trickier, but contact us about this and we&#39;ll give you a quality guesstimate on what it would take to get your print to you on an expedited basis wherever you are in the world.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I combine shipping on multiple items?\r\nA: Absolutely! For the most part, most of our products when combined with another item are significantly discounted or free when shipped with one or more items.\r\n\r\nQ: Oops! I never updated my new address, can you ship my order to a different address?\r\nA: Yes, as long as we have not already shipped it out. If you notice that you accidentally used the wrong address please send us a message as soon as possible and we&#39;ll make note of the change. If it&#39;s been more than 48 hours the odds become slim to do so, but we&#39;ll certainly try to track down all the right people to remedy this for you.\r\n\r\nQ: Dang! My package was damaged during delivery! What should I do?\r\nA: We certainly give it our best shot to ensure your items are well packaged and secured during the delivery process, but situations arise and these things sometimes are inevitable. If your item was damaged during delivery please send us a snap (mobile photos are suitable) of the damaged product as well as the damaged packaging within 3 days of receipt, we&#39;ll be more than happy to send out a complimentary replacement to you. Often times, we will need you to ship back the original order to us for insurance purposes, but should this happen we&#39;ll help walk you through what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I change\/cancel my order?\r\nA: Yes, as long as it hasn&#39;t been already shipped. If you decide that you need to alter your order please send us a message as soon as possible (usually between 12-24 hours of your placed order). \r\n*Please be aware: Should you have placed a custom or personalised order, we are unable to cancel or refund you once we have already started the design of your project.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you offer refunds\/exchanges?\r\nA: Yes. Please refer to our refund section in our Shop Policy section for more info.\r\n\r\nQ: I&#39;d like to place a large order of multiple items from your shop, do you offer any discounts for bulk orders?\r\nA: Absolutely! We occasionally run discount sales with coupon codes that you can find on our Etsy shop homepage or you can sometimes get the scoop from our Twitter and Instagram accounts as well of the specials we&#39;re offering!\r\n\r\nQ: How do I sign up for your email list?\r\nA: Simply let us know our email and we&#39;ll be happy to add your name. Alternatively, follow us on Instagram or Twitter and we&#39;ll let you know more information on where to sign up.\r\n\r\nQ: Do you offer wholesale?\r\nA: You bet! We cater to wholesalers, interior designers, galleries and retail outlets on a regular basis. Drop us a note and we&#39;ll send a custom quote to you on the products you&#39;re interested in.\r\n\r\nQ: Dang it! I just bought something yesterday at full price and now today it&#39;s on sale. Can I have the sale price instead?\r\nA: We can offer the difference in price in our store credit as longs as you purchased your item at original price and within 24 hours of the sale.\r\n\r\nQ: Oops, I forgot to use my coupon code?

Hippie Boho Chic Cognac Brown Leather Bohemian Platform Shoe. QualiCraft from Brazil. 7.5M \/ EU 38","description":"A fantastic example of the 1970s--Wood Heel Platform Leather Shoe, in Cognac Brown. Looking for a 4.5 inch Wedge heel? How about an 11 centimeter one? Get ready to FALL IN LOVE : )\n\n\u2726 \u2726 \u2726\u2726 \u2726 \nSize  7.5 M \/ EU 38 \/ UK 5.5\n\u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \n\n\u2702 THE SHOE\nThis Wooden Platform Sandal is an iconic Shoe...one of the most popular styles of its Era. Boho Chic at its finest! For Office Wear Outfits to Flower Child Weekend Minis and Maxis, EVERY woman had SEVERAL pair of platform, wedge Shoes!\n\nA Cognac Brown Leather that has aged to perfection, as its obviously well-taken care of! The wood Heel the same Cognac tones, but with lighter saturation of color. This Shoe is completely neutral and is meant to be worn with any color, just as it was back in the day. \n\nOpen toed, curved Leather with stitches and cutout detailing, the Vamp has a bit of a masculine look, with a nod to South of the Border styling.  Faux buckle sits at an angle over the &quot;cross-over&quot; strap look. A leather placket is tacked into the wood along the sides of the wood platform heel with tiny, brass studs, which helps connect the leather to the wooden bottom. Very nicely done. Both the vamp buckle and the tiny studs are the same patina&#39;d brass--can&#39;t forget the matching Buckle adjustment attaching the Leather straps at the ankle, which btw have a great vertical, single seam detailing. This Shoe has simple design features throughout, and when joined together, it makes for one very well thought out, very skillfully executed Item--made in Brazil : )\n\nWood platform is curved and tapered, quite a sophisticated hippie look! It can be a nice change from the thick, chunky wooden heel versions of the 70s wood platform. \n\nAnd certainly the best attribute, after the style itself of course, is that these shoes are extremely comfortable, as the insole is padded--they are also very sturdy which is important for a 4.5&quot; \/ 11 cm height shoe! I found them to be a joy to wear! \n\n\u2702 CONDITION \nBoth the Leather and the Wood have been professionally cleaned & polished. Heel Taps replaced. Insoles, although not in terrible shape, were reattached to help ensure a long life! The tiny studs along the top of the wedge heel are in perfect condition. There are a couple of nicks here and there in the wood, which look to be perhaps organic variations in the wood itself than actual flaws? Very tiny, almost impossible to see. I am a nitpicker, yes I know! Overall Excellent Vintage Condition. \n\n\u2702 LABELS & SIZING\n&quot;Made in Brazil for QualiCraft&quot; \/ Vintage 7 1\/2 B (medium) labeling, and surprisingly, this Vintage sizing is running true-to-modern-sizing!\n\nGENERAL INFO FOR SHOE SIZING: Vintage Shoe Sizing is often very different than how we determine shoe sizing today.  I use live Model&#39;s to try my shoes on, and I also use measurement comparisons, in order to determine what &quot;Modern Size&quot; each Shoe should be listed at. \n\n***WILL FIT A MODERN SIZE 7.5 M***\nFor International \/ EU 38  \/ UK  5.5\n\n***THIS SHOE FIT OUR SIZE 7.5 M MODEL PERFECTLY. Her foot is definitely on the MEDIUM to WIDE END***\n\nLength Insole: 9.75&quot; \/ 25 cm\nWidth Outsole: 2.75&quot; \/ 7 cm\nPlatform at Vamp Height: 5\/8&quot; \/ 1.5 cm\nHeel Height: 4.5&quot; \/ 11 cm\n\n\u2702 ABOUT THE FASHION LABEL\nAh, one of my favorite labels, as I admire the look & feel of their products AND I am fascinated with the Label&#39;s place in the history of 20th Century Middle America Business. \n\nQualiCraft produced very well-made Shoes and Boots, by sourcing great materials, employing great designers, and recruiting talented shoemakers in faraway places like Brazil and Greece. At that time, these cultures had enviable resources, i.e. workers that were skilled craftsmen in the production processes and hand-work that Qualicraft needed in order to produce a consistently superior product at a good price. This allowed QualiCraft to thrive in a very competitive marketplace, even without any fancy-nancy celebrity endorsements, or fashion week publicity! They stayed above the fray, literally setting trend after trend for Schoolgirls, Office Gals, Homemakers, and Fashion Plates everywhere. \n\nThe label managed to pull the rug out from some of the more expensive lines that were part of the &quot;elegant department store and chic boutique&quot; crowd--and they did it by appealing to the Offspring of &quot;Ladies who Lunch&quot;----at just the right time....because oh boy, the times, they were a&#39;changing!\n\nThe Young Ladies started to sneak out while Mothers were busy Lunching....to buy some QualiCraft Shoes they&#39;d seen advertised!  &quot;How Cool, I&#39;ve GOT to have them&quot;!, said one Young Lady. &quot;These are so RAD, but my Mother would kill me&quot;, said another.\n\n&quot;Exactly&quot;, they all chimed in together....and off they went, to one of the 200+ &quot;Leeds&quot; stores, to catch the massive Wave of Changing Style by making Waves at Home, all in order to catch the Changing World Wave!\n\n\n\u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \u2726 \n\nFIND MORE VINTAGE SHOES~PURSES~ACCESSORIES HERE \u2192 http:\/\/etsy.me\/1FmNeQb\nFIND THE SHOP HOME PAGE HERE \u2192 http:\/\/etsy.me\/1Dq2nCY\nFIND

My apologies!\r\n\r\nTHE ART of VINTAGE\r\n\u2765 I&#39;ve been fortunate to work in the Fashion and Art World for many years now. My very special Client list includes Vintage Lovers and Collectors, like You and Me, from over 22 Countries!  \r\n\r\n\u2765 Other Clients include Celebrities, Stylists, Models, Actors, Artists, and Designers, most of whom have a special affection for Vintage Fashion. I supply wardrobe pieces for Films, Television, Theatrical Productions, Fashion Shows, Shoots, and Editorials. \r\n\r\n\u2765 No doubt, you&#39;ve seen my pieces on Red Carpets & at Special Events all over the World. You might get a peek at my pieces on TV: Mad Men, Aquarius, Pan Am, Boardwalk Empire, Halt and Catch Fire; and in Movies like X-Men: Apocalypse (due out in 2016), American Hustle, Super 8, and Argo! \r\n\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\nReady to Take a Look?\r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/Moxie2RunwayVintage\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\n\r\nA TRUE, OBSESSIVE COLLECTOR & AFICIONADO\r\n\u2765 I&#39;m a long-time Collector deeply in awe of Bygone Eras. They are the Bomb-Diggity!  Vintage is a tangible remembrance of the past that typically generates an emotional response in us that&#39;s quite meaningful, even powerful.  I love the quality of Vintage garments;  the textiles, the prints and patterns, the details like pin-tucks and hand-stitching........and the HISTORY you can literally SEE and FEEL in authentic Vintage that is just not present in a reproduction.  It&#39;s a true honor to help preserve that past. \r\n\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\n\r\nALWAYS LOOK YOUR BEST....and LOOK INTERESTING TOO!\r\n\u2765 By wearing Vintage, you&#39;re making a statement. You are showing the World you&#39;ve got Moxie. When you walk into a room, you can be assured of four things; you will be Noticed; you will be Admired; you will be wearing a One-of-a-Kind;  AND you will feel so incredibly Special and Stylish!\r\n\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\n\r\nTHE WHO-WHAT-WHERE-WHY-WHEN\r\n\u2765 Vintage can actually be found anywhere! The trick is knowing what the really good stuff is, and how to get it----THAT&#39;S where I come in!\r\n\r\n\u2765 Traveling, researching, studying, bidding, seeking, always looking, always peeking in windows or in attics, great Vintage is time-consuming & very expensive to research & study, to find, buy, properly ship, professionally fix and store appropriately......whew! But oh so worth it.....and I swear it CALLS OUT to me!! \r\n\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\n\r\nFABULOUS RESTORATIVE ARTISANS & HIGH STANDARDS\r\n\u2765 Vintage often needs some very expensive gussying up!  Repairs, proper cleaning, restoration and preservation, all done professionally, are the cornerstones of my personal philosophy for collecting Vintage. Therefore, the vast majority of my items are in Excellent Vintage Condition as it&#39;s my preference to offer wearable investment pieces that can stand the continued test of time.\r\n\r\n\u2765 I use a Professional, Vintage Cleaning Specialist that has access to the latest methods, using GreenEarth technology among others. This ensures the integrity of the fabric remains intact and the colors are enhanced and preserved. It&#39;s a beautiful thing!\r\n\r\n\u2765 My favorite Seamstress has unbelievable talent. I am officially jealous. She&#39;s a genius when it comes to restoration and repair, and is always &quot;game&quot; when I present her with yet another difficult challenge. Well, maybe not always...sometimes she just rolls her eyes at me : ) Specific restorations are noted in each listing. We address zippers, buttons, hems, open seams, holes or tears, staining issues, repair of draping fabrics, shirring, that sort of thing. Often repairs \/ restorations  are done underneath the lining. Often hand-stitching is used. It really is quite impressive.\r\n\r\n\u2765 My Shoe Guy Aleksandr--wow---this Cobbler is a master of Shoe Repair. Well known for miles around, if a shoe or bag CAN be restored, he is the one to do it. Lately I have noticed Aleksandr has been out on vacation; with his Dad and his Son taking over the Shop.  I fully expect the Son to take over full-time someday, although I&#39;ve heard he is going to go to college first...lol I just realized that I alone have probably funded quite a large chunk of his College education with all the projects I&#39;ve had his Dad working on over the years!! Not a good sign for me....could it mean I&#39;ve collected too many shoes and boots perhaps??\r\n\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\n\r\nIGNITE THE FIRE\r\n\u2765 I am quite interested in creating that first SPARK of interest in Vintage in children AND adults. I trust that if properly nurtured, this spark will indubitably grow into a roaring LOVE for Vintage and History!  This is one of the reasons I participate in Mentoring programs.  \r\n\r\n\u2765 To this purpose, I assist with Vintage Fashion Shows, Costumed & Period Events, Historical Presentations & Reenactments at Elementary Schools, High Schools, Colleges, as well as Community Education opportunities. I can&#39;t forget the Senior Citizens too. I&#39;ve planned and executed Vintage Wedding Shows in Retirement Communities, and Dance Festivals with &quot;Fashions Thru the Ages&quot; Themes. This is education and fund raising at its MOST MAGICAL!\r\n\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\nReady to Browse?\r\nClick Here \u2911 \r\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/Moxie2RunwayVintage\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\n\r\nHERE COMES THE BRIDE\r\n\u2765 I&#39;ve searched the world over for unique, stunning Bridal Gowns. Sometimes they are in Excellent Vintage Condition. Sometimes they need a little repair. Sometimes they need a LOT of restoration. Rather than repairing or restoring Bridal items, I adjust the price according to their condition. We do it this way because ideally, these are processes driven by the Bride from the very first step, and any repairs or restoration should be incorporated into the design processes that will be used to achieve the Brides&#39;s desired outcome. The Bride & her local Design Team should be the one to direct that process.\r\n\r\n\u2765 Sometimes the real value of the item for Sale is in the textiles, lace, etc., and a whole new Gown can be made.\r\n\r\n\u2765 Please note, we typically, we do not clean Bridal, unless noted in Listing.  \r\n\r\nWould you like to see our Vintage Wedding Dresses?

A &#39;Small&#39; from the 1950s is not the same as a &#39;Small&#39; from today. This is true for items that are for Men, Women, and Children, and affects Clothing, Shoes and Boots. Vintage tends to run small, although not always. For your convenience, every item we list has a MODERN SIZE conversion!\r\n\r\n\u2765 I&#39;m more than happy to assist you with sizing, just send me a message.\r\n\r\n~~~~&lt;&gt;~~~~\r\n\r\nKNOWLEDGE IS KING\r\n\u2765 When thinking about making a purchase from me, I encourage you to make an informed decision. For the best result, please read the entire listing, and review my Shop Policies and Shipping Information before making your purchase. I welcome questions! Additional photos can always be sent--just ask!

Here are several questions we get quite often that might help to understand what we offer:\r\n\r\n+ FAQ +\r\n\r\nQ: Do you offer custom or personalised prints? How much does this cost?\r\nA: A resounding yes! We cherish doing custom or personalised work. We don&#39;t charge you any additional fee for doing it either! All we ask is that you purchase the custom listing we&#39;ll set up for you first before we begin any work. Once you&#39;ve done that, we&#39;ll work directly with you by sending you proofs and revisions until we reach a final approved design.\r\n\r\nQ: Do your photos come framed? How much does it cost to add a frame?\r\nA: Unfortunately, no. All of the frames pictured in our listing photos are simply mockups and were created to demonstrate how your print will appear once framed. We can however make recommendations of affordable framers in your area as well as being able to recommend what you need to ask a framer to get your order to look like ours.\r\n\r\nQ: How long does it take for you to ship my print?\r\nA: We process all orders the day that they are placed and get them printed and shipped out anywhere between 3-5 days for standard orders! Prints that are oversized  may take 7-14 days before shipment.\r\n\r\nQ: But my order is time sensitive! Do you offer rush shipping?\r\nA: Yes! We offer shipping upgrades to ensure a speedier delivery. If you need it really quick, please contact us and we&#39;ll see what else we can do. A lot of times with rush order we can have your order in your possession in 48-72 hours (in the USA). International orders can be rushed, but a 48 hour turnaround can be trickier, but contact us about this and we&#39;ll give you a quality guesstimate on what it would take to get your print to you on an expedited basis wherever you are in the world.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I combine shipping on multiple items?\r\nA: Absolutely! For the most part, most of our products when combined with another item are significantly discounted or free when shipped with one or more items.\r\n\r\nQ: Oops! I never updated my new address, can you ship my order to a different address?\r\nA: Yes, as long as we have not already shipped it out. If you notice that you accidentally used the wrong address please send us a message as soon as possible and we&#39;ll make note of the change. If it&#39;s been more than 48 hours the odds become slim to do so, but we&#39;ll certainly try to track down all the right people to remedy this for you.\r\n\r\nQ: Dang! My package was damaged during delivery! What should I do?\r\nA: We certainly give it our best shot to ensure your items are well packaged and secured during the delivery process, but situations arise and these things sometimes are inevitable. If your item was damaged during delivery please send us a snap (mobile photos are suitable) of the damaged product as well as the damaged packaging within 3 days of receipt, we&#39;ll be more than happy to send out a complimentary replacement to you.

(Fragrance will return to it&#39;s solid state once cooled.)\r\n\r\nHow To Use Solid Perfumes:\r\nSimply rub your finger over the surface of the perfume, and then apply to any area of the body, preferably pulse points (your body heat will strengthen the scent). Solid perfumes are for external use only. DO NOT use as lip balm, or on sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nAllergies:\r\nRead all ingredients carefully before ordering, please - especially if you have known allergies to certain fragrances. Ingredients may be found on each product page, in the &quot;overview&quot; section. Please contact the Madame if you have any questions or concerns. She is generally very quick at replying.\r\n\r\nWholesale:\r\nMost items are available for wholesale, and custom orders are welcome. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask! However, we will not do consignment and we will not ship our products to you without labels. It&#39;s the beard or nothing, baby.\r\nIf you are inquiring about a wholesale order, please provide the following info:\r\n\u2013 Your shop name and physical location.\r\n\u2013\u00a0Website if possible, or any social media links to your business.\r\n\u2013\u00a0Images of your shop (this is very important, as we want to ensure that we will be a good fit in your space).\r\n\u2013 A list of the products you are interested in carrying.\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nPlease note that packages can be delayed in customs for a number of reasons, and on rare occasion you may have to pay an additional fee to claim your package. We apologize that we have no control over this situation. Also please know your country&#39;s guidelines and restrictions for international packages. The most typical reason for packages held in customs is that an item contained within is prohibited by that country.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\nWe are perfectionists and we are pleasers. We receive very little negative feedback, and of course we&#39;d like to keep it that way! We understand that you may not like the scent you ordered \u2013 everyone&#39;s nose experiences scents differently. Before leaving any harsh feedback, please do consider other aspects of your experience here. We are quite proud of our packaging, customer service and speedy shipping.

My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach.
